hello-world
I have keen interest in knowing how to design websites for desktop browsers.However i am totally new to this, but i will love to learn it. Also in the past few years this area increased very fastly which means demand of web designers also increased rapidally.It has many scopes. The part i liked about being a web designer, is that almost every organisation can give job to it.Also a web designer can work itself
without any restrictions. I like to learn about HTML,CSS,JavaScript.
